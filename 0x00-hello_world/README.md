This directory contains solutions to the project tasks

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

- C programming

## Resources
**Read or watch:**

- “C” Programming Language: Brian Kernighan
- Why C Programming Is Awesome
- Learning to program in C part 1
- Learning to program in C part 2
- Understanding C program Compilation Process
- Betty Coding Style
